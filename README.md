# Stormpath OmniAuth Strategy

Stormpath is the first easy, secure user management and authentication service
for developers. This is an OmniAuth strategy that will integrate with Stormpath.

## Quickstart Guide

1. From the root of the repo, navigate to the dummy directory and execute the
   following Rake tasks:

   ```sh
   cd spec/dummy
   rake db:migrate
   rake db:test:prepare
   ```

1. You should then be able to run the full suite of specs from the root of the
   repo, like so:

   ```sh
   rake spec
   ```
